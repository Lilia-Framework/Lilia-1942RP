<h1>Ideal too Idiosyncrasy: A National Socialist struggle</h1>
<h3>By Gerd Dietmar Gebhardt</h3>
<p>
The Author's Introduction:

I, Gerd Dietmar Gebhardt, was born on the 15th of August, 1904,
to a firm though fair family within the expansive outskirts
of the East-Prussian city of Konnigsberg. I grew to be an individual 
of vigilance and intellect. Being one that never undermines his studies, 
I enacted upon my astute curiosity for the knowledge of the world, 
both good and evil, that came to be apparent through each article, 
each book, even each film that so came across my field of view within 
such small portions of my mortal existence on this Earth. I could recall 
my youngest years as some of my greatest, living within a better Germany 
of autocracy and armament came to be no less than benefits of a stronger Germany. 
However, even amongst the antiquated system of cronyistic monarchy, ramifications 
were bound and plentiful. Nonetheless, such a better Germany would, as I am sure that 
many of you already know, come to a most dramatically detrimental end for the true Germans 
that survived the struggles of the Great War. From it, came the misery and malefactors 
that were bred from the traitors of versailles. Growing through such numerous economic 
recessions and minor resolutions, the older and younger generations were desiring a leader, 
a F�hrer, one that would remove those that bastardized our traditions and customs as the superior 
Germanic peoples of this world. Hitler would come, come with a purifying flame of proper ideals 
over the absurdities to be found within the democratic and communist agitators of foreign promotion. 
Karl Marx himself was a jew, even many bankers, politicians, and businessmen of the prodigious democratic 
and capitalistic markets would breed further discourse and descent for the pure of race. However, 
in the end, the F�hrer offered a remedy that Germany so craved for the years of humiliation that 
followed from the collapse of the fickle government, including the abdication of a most insipid Kaiser. 
From it, came a most fickle government with insipid presidents, such that merely proposed that submission 
to the demands of the treaty of Versaillies would be beneficial. Some were merely, arrogantly printing more 
Reichsmarks in the hopes of revitalizing the German economy, in truth, many of them were simply of profoundly 
erroneous principles. After years of dedication to the fatherland and German people, the F�hrer would provide 
employment, economic stimulation and stability, rearmament and revitalisation of the armed force, just as 
he also came to firmly stand against the blighters of democracies and communist tyrants that wished to embed 
foreign politics into our pure peoples of Germany. Democracy is foerign, communism is foerign, traditional 
autocracy is as old and as efficient as the Germanic peoples are. Such being stated, the Germanic peoples 
required more than just a recreation of the old systems of the Kaisers that came before, no, Germany 
required more than just nationalism within our foreign and domestic politics. Germany required a 
National Socialist movement, such that it would deter the efforts of the Marxist socialist, 
Leninist Bolshevik, and progressive democrat alike. I came to serve my nation as I am currently 
serving to publish articles and documents that promote the truth of the National Socialist 
struggle. By extension, in contriving this document, I shall extend my most imperative 
arguments to affirm the position of a man that tires from a most implicating ideal. Such an ideal 
would consist of the apparent repercussions from those that appraise the insignia over the ideal. 
For some, it is merely a matter of profit. Whether it be for procuring power, profit, position, ect, 
one understands that peoples within the Reich are afflicted by such a malady of desire for distinctful 
degradation. If we, as a people, are to survive this arduous struggle of ours, we must be reminded of the 
fact that �There is a road to freedom. Its milestones are obedience, endeavor, honesty, order, cleanliness, 
sobriety, truthfulness, sacrifice, and love of the fatherland.� - Adolf Hitler

Chapter I: National Socialism

In truth, a true National Socialist, in accordance with the National Socialist ideal and doctrines, understands the notions of such provision of obedience and discipline within the ranks of the Reich. Such being stated, the intentions of each individual German shall subsequently determine the outcome of this war. Each man and woman must facilitate the equilibrium between the great ideal and each individual�s idiosyncrasies. Moreover, the German peoples must obey the obligatory regulations of the National Socialist ideal, though they must also maintain a due amount of creativity and independence that accords with such veracity of National Socialism. Indeed, as the title of this scripture so appropriately addresses, The ideal is to be above the idiosyncrasy of inherently present proportions. The urges of man should not envelop the man, instead, it should be such ideals and principles of a persistently advancing racial congregation. You are to be Germany, we are to be Germans. Those that do not align themselves with the aforementioned National Socialist virtues that are clearly stated by the F�hrer, Adolf Hiter, are those that intentionally or unintentionally degrade the prominence of the Reich and the fertility of the Germanic people. Under no circumstances will the National Socialist State tolerate that the politicization of the confessions be prolonged or even begun anew by any type of detour. And let no one delude himself as to the determination of the Movement and the State! We have already fought a battle against the political clergy and ousted it from the parliaments, and that after a long struggle in which we had no stabilized state or authority, we had prevailed and triumphed from comparative retrospection. Today, we have this authority and will more easily be able to win the struggle for the principles that shall affirm the Germanic peoples within the world. However, we will never wage this battle as a battle against Christianity or even against one of the two confessions. But we will wage it in order to keep our public life pure and free of those priests who have mistaken their calling, those who should have become politicians and not clergymen. In truth, for some, they could differ to only a limited extent from clergymen to jewish rabbi�s. Though we desire to preserve the Christian and Catholic faiths, they must contribute faith to a fatherland that is perceivably theirs to serve, and by extension, to the National Socialist movement. Furthermore, to understand the facets of National Socialism, one must first acknowledge the literal meaning for it. Nationalism; such would refer to the preservation of the individual spirit and tradition of the race. Socialism; Unlike the feral marxists from the past, the F�hrer had come to redefine a socialism that incorporated the respect of preserving the individual facets of independent man whilst also promoting the duty of the individual to the ideal, race, and fatherland. In summary, a true National Socialist is a proper proportion of individual characteristics and of dedicated devotion to nation and people. �In the past that is, for most people it is still the present, the individual is everything, everything is directed at maintaining his life and improving his existence, everything focuses on him. � In socialism of the future, on the other hand, what counts is the whole, the community of the Volk. The individual and his life play only a subsidiary role.� 
-  Adolf Hiter.

The pervasiveness of parasites and the three sacred rules:

Relative to the notion of the degradation of a National Socalist, the parasite is one that allows the inheritance of the fictitious falsehoods of erroneous deceivers. A parasite will come within a great number of proportions, from those that hold little weight within the Reich, and those that could be occupying the highest offices of the government. It is your duty as a true National Socialist to remove any that lack the most important virtues of the ideology. Such would be loyalty, discipline, and above all, discipline. Such qualities are to be attributed to those of true dedication and commitment to the Reich and the believers of the National Socialist movement. If you are a citizen, it is your duty and obligation to report those that are provable to being against the National Socialist ideal and the nation. If you are within the ranks of the divisions within the Reich, it is your sacred duty to report and ,subsequently, remove such facilitators of follies and fanatical frays for malign malefactors. If you come to occupy the highest offices within the land, it is your responsibility to extract those that dilute the politics of the nation from the interior halls of the Reichstag. In undergoing such an arduous test, in enduring and prevailing to fight for the belief over incompetence and insipid foolishness within the Reich, we may smite the heretics of bygone political affiliations and races, such as to filter the most loyal, obedient and disciplined men from the disorganized shambles of a corrupt and inefficient system. In enacting against the parasite, against such most insidiously devious degenerates, we may finally begin to continue this peregrination of our own volition and pervasiveness. We must contend with pervasiveness with our own pervasiveness to garner greater stability and protection for those that shall come after our time. A parasite may be your Major, it may be your General, it may be your GruppenF�hrer, the enemies of the Reich could very well be everywhere and anywhere. It is your duty, as a German, as a loyal patriot, as a dedicated National Socialist, to appraise and assess the ideal of National Socialism over the insignia, medals, badges, ranks and classifications of any that stand within the Reich. However, we need not forget that not all within the Reich are capable of being a parasite themselves. For example, a true National Socialist would never claim for the F�hrer, Adolf Hitler, to be no less of a dedicated National Socialist than the very scriptures that he prescribed to many within his most appreciated and prominently available memoir, �Mein Kampf�. Be vigilant, be prepared, observe, obligate, and if necessary, eliminate those that are contrary to the National Socialist doctrines of the Germanic speaking peoples. �Nature knows no indecencies; man invents them.� 
- Heinrich Himmler. 

The Content of Castrators:

Castrate: To deprive of power, vitality, or vigor. 

Content: A state of satisfaction.

Need we not forget, the pervasive parasite shall be facilitated and fortified by the contentment of the ignorant castrators. One within the Reich should never undermine the implications that may follow from the blatant disregard of even a select few, whether National Socialist or not, ignorance is such a characteristic that may be inherited by almost all within the Reich. Though such being stated, the virtue of acute observation is one to practice and to nearly perfect within due time. A true German and National Socialist must not be as arrogant and ignorant as some implicit and explicit enemies within, and outside of the Reich are. As to indulge the reader within a fitting analogy, compare the Jew, homosexual, communist, ect, to that of a tactful monster that grows once another individual is born from, or otherwise propagated by, the lies of those that desire disorder, degeneracy, chaos, disruption, and affliction of large proportions for the truly Germanic peoples. The peoples that are uneducated, uniformed, unobservant and unqualified for appropriate cultivation of the Germanic peoples, such that are unwilling to undertake the tasks that each german must achieve to promote the dignity of the purifying flame of National Socialism, act as a given sword for the beast of the blackguards to utilize against our cause, and by extension, against the Germanic peoples, the Germanic Nation, Germany itself. In summary, the blatant disregard for disobedience and lackful discipline within the Reich are the factors of which the Enemies of the Reich may exploit, such as to ultimately destroy from within. Never forget, though we may be fighting an enemy abroad, we must fight the enemies that infiltrate the very ranks within our divisions. German citizens to Highly-ranking officials alike, we must continually commence the cleansing of filth that invades us from within the very walls of your home, the very stalls of military guarding posts, even the very halls of the Reichstag itself. Indeed, each true German must understand the fundamental concept of enacting to facilitate the equilibrium between the interior and exterior environments that comprise the glorious Reich of ours. The people must understand the detriment that contentment and, or complacency of degeneracy can bring to a nation and its people. It is the Willingness F�hrer and his loyal supporters to not merely be content with stopping in poland, France, Russia, and even Great Britain and the United States, that shall insure that our most demanding endeavors shall eventually be undertaken, such to the extents of a total victory for the Germanic peoples and the National Socialist cause. Furthermore, it shall take the dedicated initiative of those with profoundly extraordinary efforts to keep our fatherland safe from the prying eyes of the International alliance of jewish thievery and thuggery. Allow the torch of Hitler to guide the Germanic peoples to glory, just as it has within the years in which this war has lasted and fately favored our righteous path to progress and prosperity for those that are truly deserving of such. Each and every German shall come to be crucial pieces that are combined to form the mite of our Germany warmachine and government. It stands on your shoulders to decide as to whether you shall fulfill the duties of obligatory exertions of Germanically superior characteristics and attributes, or to otherwise contribute to the petulant parasites of blatantly perceivable failures and fantasies. Well then, on which side of this barbed wire fence shall you stand on? Within this continuous war, there are not to be fence sitters. You are either a National Socialist or an abolitionist that pulls or is pulled by the strings of bureaucratic blackguards that scheme and surmise to eventually destroy the Germanic nation, as well as facilitating the notion of needing to be rid of our virtues of independent protectionism and conservative purity.      

The contents of Ignorance: 
 
As was briefly mentioned within the previous section of this text, the ignorance of men and women within the Reich is a most insidious malefactor to our cause and people. Within the context of the current struggles on the homefront and in the front lines, to ignore the most minute details and factors within portioned environments could greatly delay our efforts to garner a most glorious victory within Europe and abroad. As ignorance itself will comprise an extensive number of facets to differing contexts, one may come to be disoriented when designating such categories that constitute the environments that represent our ideological battlefields. As such, I shall be readily available to provide a summarized diagram for the political environments that must be maintained and monitored by all loyal German peoples of the National Socialist movement. 

Figure 1: (Below). Appropriately pronounced as �the Richter chart�, such a diagram consists of the aforementioned political environments within the world.

Within regards to the Richter chart, one could observe such categories that amalgamate to form the basis for a summarized representation of our scope of German existence. Domestic, Operating and Abroad. Such that we consider environments that require our fullest attention and supervision. Designations for Germanic peoples are not to be made however, as all National Socialist Germans must consider the surroundings that contribute to the state and its people. Within domestic life, one must ensure that the family, relatives and the home are kept organized and maintained within accordance with the National Socialist ideal. Within the operating life, one must consider the extent to which other Germans serve the country and the people, as well as observing the loyalties and characteristics of co-workers within jobs and businesses alike. Even your friends are to be subject to suspicion, giving one all the more of a reason to keep their guard up. Finally, the Abroad life would consist of maintaining and promoting the National Socialist ideals within foreign lands and occupation zones. Such environments would of course be extensively applicable to those that serve within the armed forces of the Reich, as well as ensuring that even fellow soldiers are not having their beliefs diluted by foreigners. In summary, contrary to ignorance, comprehension is vital to the success of the German peoples and the state. National Socialism must be facilitated within all environments of a German's life, as wherever he or she may go, National Socialism will go with them and stay with them. 

Chapter 2: The reliability of rational remedies:

Upon presenting to you, the reader, the maladies that currently plague our Reich with decadence and deception, one should understand the necessity in presenting remedies. However, within consideration of remedies to be presented, one must understand that desperation can lead to destitution. As such, rationality within mind is crucial when presented with the issues of a most profound proportion. Before one is to enact upon the advice of another, even for someone such as myself, comprehend and analyze the National Socialist scriptures, learn and revise from the teachings of Hitler himself. Know that, within all consideration of reason, one should understand National Socialism and its doctrines as such may very well prevent a most wicked fate to befall even those of Germanic descent. Within all environments that accords the Richter chart, one must understand that many peoples may attempt to feed deception and propaganda through to you and other Germanic peoples. Trust is built with time, bonds are facilitated through the comradery and contribution of the peoples, one must ask what they may do for their country, or what their country can do for them. The people are the country, the country are the people. Within the following section of this book, any true National Socialist would wish for the reader to accord such statements presented with the scriptures and doctrines of National Socialism. Such is of course applicable to other promoted words and phrases within other scriptures as well. To engage in respectful comprehension carefully and efficiently, follow the four steps for careful reading. 

 Observe the cover, blurb, author, and official publishing information of a book, and ask yourself, �Is this of National Socialist Origin�?
If  the book is not so explicitly against National Socialism, continue to search the table of contents within the first few pages of the text, (such as to review the summarized topics and points of discussion within the text).
If the messages are not so explicit within both aforementioned facets, one must continue to read the words that are present within the book. If the content is proven to be against the National Socialist ideal and doctrines.
If the text is found to be slandering against the National Socialist movement and the German nation, report such to the Ministry of the Interior for further investigation into the matter.

The proposition of recondition:

After stating the clear importance of analyzing and comprehending materials and recommendations. Firstly, one must understand that for actions to be taken against the degeneracy of this within the Reich, one must consolidate the support and appreciation of contriving embedding legislation. Furthermore, it is our duty as National Socialists to implement the regulations and laws that shall come to facilitate order and security within the Reich. With each coming day, the parasite would infect our policies, plague or peoples, degrade our military mite, and destroy us from within if true-blooded Germans are not willing to serve as honorable deputies to the Reich and the people. Some would consider binding legislative action to be reprehensible and perhaps even unreasonable, though a true National Socialist will follow the scriptures, will follow the doctrines of the movement and the party, he or she shall follow Hitler, to dedicate themselves tirelessly, as to procure the lasting safety for the young and needing. Specifically, legislation that regards a further restriction of speech, activity, conduct and proper etiquette is necessary to implement true order and security for the generations to come after. Activities that include displays of degeneracy should be punished to the fullest extent of the states power, such that shall ultimately limit the potential of the parasite to regain a significant foothold within the main divisions of the Reich. For each living German, it is necessary for you to remove the stainful vermin by means of affirming the necessity of introducing a new bill. Such a bill would come to serve the German people in ensuring stricter punishments for even minor misconduct. In stating such notions of misconduct, one must understand what examples are to be presented as misconduct on behalf of all German citizens and National Socialists. Such language that includer silly noises and pitches, terms such as �bro or bruv, dude, yo, sup, including unnecessary acronyms such as LOL, OMG, LMAO,YOLO, etcetera, should strictly never be uttered by any man, woman or child within the Reich. Any true National Socialist shall not utter such words as they are not Germanic in nature and decent, and to state such would be an act of deplorable conduct on the person�s behalf. Furthermore, the inappropriate utilization of terms such as thirsty, drippy, naughty, cool, nigga, etcetera, and the enacting of unnecessary actions such as jumping, climbing, building, breaking, etcetera, should be strictly forbidden under the regulations of a true National Socialist Government. Such should be applicable to all hours of the day, including within time of low population quantities within Berlin. It is the responsibility of the German people to be of acceptable standard when regarding one�s presentation, etiquette and conduct. Need you be as the parasite is, lacking control and proper decency?

The methodology of implementation:

Though I elucidate upon the importance of imbedding rules that shall ultimately serve to provide a greater degree of obedience, loyalty, and above all, discipline, it is of a pointing pursuit in embedding such laws without providing manners for one to properly enforce the regulations to be made within the aforementioned legislation. Each individual German must understand, the true National Socialists are watching you, and if you are to step out of line within even a small regard, you shall be punished severely, such could include imprisonment, removal or ranks, demotions and stripping of insignia�s (within the divisions of the Reich, and after repeat offenses, PK should be allowed to rid the Reich of internal degeneracy. With such a bill, the German fatherland will be a most prosperous and secure nation for the future generations of German stock. Though we may possess pure Germans in blood, a true German must also be pure within his or her beliefs and characteristics. As such, this new movement to incorporate stricter punishment among those that disgrace the National Socialist agenda and efforts should be called �The German Reconditioning Movement�, otherwise to be known as the (GRM). Furthermore, with the full cooperation of such enforcement across all environments within the Reich, including all the various divisions that come to comprise the Reich and its peoples, are necessary for the subsequent efforts in enforcing the law of The German Reconditioning Movement. For a true National Socialist, he or she is obligated to assist in reconditioning the German population, such as to cleanse and condition pure Germans, both of blood and spirit, within the Reich. It is not enough to be acceptable by blood. The overwhelming necessity to obey and to obligate for the German Reconditioning Movement is fundamental for the preservation of the German culture and the German spirit, such that has been preserved for thousands upon thousands of years of conserving our traditions and virtues of a true German, a true National Socialist, pure. If a German within any division or aspect of the Reich is allowing their ignorance and arrogance to blind their better judgment, then punishments are duly needed as well. For those that are not to obligate themselves to the task of duly reporting degenerates that are either within their view or under their supervision to the appropriate authorities, the punishments of lackful attention to facilitating National Socialist virtues would consider demotions, stripping of ranks, stripping of insignia and positions, and imprisonment. In Summary, the individual should understand the crucial actions that are necessary in implementing due regulations for conduct, mannerisms, and etiquette. Remember, the German Reconditioning Movement is no longer an idea, as it shall be a reality for all true National Socialist to congregate and conspire for the greater good of the German peoples and the nation.

 The obligation of the nation: 

It does not have to be necessary to be told or stated to Germany peoples once more, we have a duty to fulfill, for the fatherland, for the F�hrer, for the German peoples, and for the German nation. After that the order for rearmament. Here again there were numerous prophets who predicted misfortunes, and only a few believers. In 1935 came the introduction of compulsory military service. After that, militarization of the Rhineland, again a step believed to be impossible at that time. Then, the beginning of the fortification of the whole country, especially in the West, would commence and be completed. Though the efforts of the National Socialist peoples, of the German Reconditioning Movement, of the German people, may be strenuous, laborious, grueling, and unbearable, it is your responsibility as a German to defend Germans. Within the institution of necessary alterations to state legislation, the extent of which National Socialism could be enforced upon not just Germany, but also upon other occupied states and territories, shall be greatly increased. Within the dawn of this new age, the fight must start here. No nation can evade the solution of this problem. Otherwise it must yield and gradually go down. That is taught by history. If a nation chooses the course of ignorance and arrogance, all its weaknesses shall be mobilized for the world to observe. One yields to force from the outside and uses this force against oneself by the killing of temptation and idiosyncrasies of primitive man. Such would represent the greatest dedication of strength to the cause. Destitution and despair took hold of the Volk. For all true Germans, we would remember the years that followed the war. 
One would remember the subsequent inflation, robbing the people of all means of sustenance, the times of rampant unemployment, of enormous numbers of suicides within Germany. The National Socialist Movement came into being because of this great poverty; and from its beginnings it had to make the most difficult decisions. 
One of these decisions was the decision to revolt within the Beer-hall Putsch of November 8, 1923. It ended in failure, or so it appeared at the time. Still, its sacrifices brought the delivery of Germany. Sixteen dead, though millions of lives were revived through their deaths. National Socialism then set out on its triumphant march. We are those that continue this march, men, women, and children alike. Though the likes of the internal parasites may wish to rid us of our pride and dignity as Germany people, they shall never destroy the German nation entirely! Therefore, it is the fealty of all Germans to carry through the life and the security of the German peoples, the Reich and the National Socialist movement, under any and all circumstances! The fate shall lie within your hands, though I shall fight for you, just as any National Socialist shall fight for their true people and their true fatherland. Let it not be you that lay wounded from the bayonet of National Socialist adulation.

The author�s conclusion:

I truly believe, within accordance with true National Socialist beliefs, that the revival of the German character and spirits within themselves is very possible. The implementation and enactment of policy is what has procured our generation the luxury and comfort to come within the systematic incorporation of the National Socialist ideal within our politics and within our domestic life. Though failure may have struck our ability to continue to promote the prominence of the movement into the coming future, failure is only the beginning to a new dawn for theGermanic peoples to believe in the strictly affirm National Socialist doctrine. Those such as the F�hrer, Adolf Hitler, knew of the failures from the misfortune of fate. We now walk upon streets of dedicated labor and German resilience that was ultimately embedded within us by the F�hrer. It is our sacred duty to embed purity within others and ourselves. Failure, within all its diminishing potential, led to the revitalisation of the Germanic peoples and the German state. �The apparent failure led to the birth of the great National Socialist Liberation Movement. It was as a result of this failure that the big trial came about, which allowed us, for the first time, to step before the public in defense of our views, our goals; it allowed this decision of ours to bear the responsibility in order to acquaint the broad mass of our Volk with our ideas.� - Adolf Hitler; Munich, November 8, 1939.
The future belongs to Germany! Heil Hitler! Sieg Hiel!
