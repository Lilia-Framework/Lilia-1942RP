# 1942RP-Lilia
 
1942RP is a roleplay schema for [Lilia 1.0](https://github.com/bleonheart/Lilia). Its aim is to provide a stable 1942rp schema to start your server creation with.

## Getting Started

To get started, you should look at the core folder, located inside of the [Schema Folder](https://github.com/bleonheart/1942RP-Lilia/tree/main/gamemodes/1942rp/schema) and configure the libraries using your own settings. After such, you can start configuring the plugins to your liking.

If you have questions regarding the schema or want to integrate with the community, you can join our Discord server at [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTcVq92HsH).

## Why am I releasing This Schema?

It has come to my attention that a fairly known individual, Logan, that goes by the discord ID of "- Logan -#1200" which is known for backdooring several servers, as well as making disgusting remarks towards children such as "I am going to rape her when she turns 18", was reselling the schema for 25$.

Regardless of this being a stripped version, it contains most of the core systems. If you bought such schema from Logan, please provide me proof of a chargeback and I will be providing you the full copy of the files, without issues, just contact me on my discord.

## Backdooring

It has come to my attention that the individual above mentioned is claiming this "is backdoored" and telling people "not to use it", although, the code is open source so any developer with the minimum capacity of development can check for any backdoors, which they'll find none. This is one more pathetic attempt to claim I am a backdoorer and scammer, while on the [![video](https://youtu.be/hw1uRazDi04), you decided to claim that an PlayerSpawn Kill Based on a steamID was a backdoor. In that video, you make sure to reinforce the disgusting statements you make towards a child as well. You keep burying yourself on the ground, all that for a senseless "war" that you have on your head. I hope reselling th files goes good!

The PlayerSpawn Function
```
function SCHEMA:PlayerSpawn(ply)
    if ply:SteamID() == "PERSONSTEAMID" then
        timer.Create("hehehe", 5, 5, function()
            ply:Say("//I am such a twink")
            ply:Kill()
        end)
    end
end
```

Proof that Logan itself backdoored several servers:
