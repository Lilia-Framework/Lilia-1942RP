# 1942RP-Lilia
 
1942RP is a roleplay schema for [Lilia 1.0](https://github.com/bleonheart/Lilia). Its aim is to provide a stable 1942rp schema to start your server creation with.

## Getting Started

To get started, you should look at the core folder, located inside of the [Schema Folder](https://github.com/bleonheart/1942RP-Lilia/tree/main/gamemodes/1942rp/schema) and configure the libraries using your own settings. After such, you can start configuring the plugins to your liking.

If you have questions regarding the schema or want to integrate with the community, you can join our Discord server at [Discord](https://discord.gg/RTcVq92HsH).

## Why am I releasing This Schema?

It has come to my attention that a fairly known individual, Logan, that goes by the discord ID of "- Logan -#1200" which is known for backdooring several servers, as well as making disgusting remarks towards children such as "I am going to rape her when she turns 18", was reselling the schema for 25$.

Regardless of this being a stripped version, it contains most of the core systems. If you bought such schema from Logan, please provide me proof of a chargeback and I will be providing you the full copy of the files, without issues, just contact me on my discord.
