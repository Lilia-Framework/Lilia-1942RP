# Disclaimer

It has come to my attention that some individuals are claiming that this schema is backdoored. If you wish to test it for backdoors, you can find several tools for such. One of the most well-known is [nomalua](https://github.com/mtz629/nomalua/tree/master), but you can find more online if needed. For any half-experienced developer, this is open-source code, therefore it can be analyzed for any backdoors. If you are afraid, proceed to do so.
